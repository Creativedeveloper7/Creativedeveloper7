- 👋 Hi, I’m @Creativedeveloper7
- 👀 I’m interested in Human Centered Design / film Directing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning  AI Creative Design, Product simuations and Ethical Product hack: n "ethical product hack" refers to a
- creative or innovative solution that enhances the ethical aspects of a product, making it more sustainable, socially responsible,
-  or environmentally friendly. This could involve modifying the product's design, materials, production process, or packaging to
-  align with ethical principles. Ethical product hacks aim to improve the overall impact of a product on people and the planet
-  while maintaining its functionality and appeal.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on design experience and creative interaction with all leading brands which share a common goal as I do.
